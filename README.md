## Static Artist Portfolio Site

Website to showcase some homemade stuff! This site features two different galleries (with the same layout design). For the main design, I decided to go with react-card-flip. To make it interesting, in the CMS, I offered input fields for the client to choose card background and font color choices.

## Tech:

Gatsby, Cloudinary, Strapi CMS, getForm, Masonry grid
